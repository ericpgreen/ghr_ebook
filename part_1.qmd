## Start with a Team and a Question

A clearly stated research question and a strong team motivated to get answers are the building blocks of success in global health research. The same could probably be said about most research domains, but I'll argue that meaningful and effective collaborations are uniquely essential to global health. They're so important that I've chosen to slot the chapter on collaborations *ahead of* the chapter on research questions. I did this to emphasize an ideal order of operations that starts with team formation before proceeding to collaborative framing of the research problem and question.

Before discussing collaborations, however, we need to establish a shared understanding of what we mean by 'global health research'. That's where we'll start.
