    "text": "“”\nFigure 1: Watch me deliver this speech to the Global Health Class of 2022\n\n\n\nMoms and dads, friends and family, colleagues and guests, I would like to add my warm welcome and thank you for gathering with us to celebrate this fantastic group of students. I know your loved ones through a course I teach on how to conduct research.\nAs a core requirement for the major, my research course is like court-appointed therapy for some students. Not everyone joins willingly, but everyone participates. Some even tell me they enjoyed it. On a recent evaluation, one student went so far as to write, “It was not as bad as I expected”. As a father of two kids, I accept this for the high praise that it is, and I’m sincerely honored that they asked me to share the message today.\nGraduates, you are the reason that I will conclude my remarks with optimism, but before I get there, I want to outline some of the challenges facing science and how you are called to help.\nScience, and scientists, are under attack. That was the warning that Dr. Peter Hotez shared with me and a small group of junior professors when he visited Duke in 2018 to give an invited lecture. Peter is the Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine and an expert on neglected tropical diseases. Many of you would recognize him from TV. He’s right out of central casting for the role of ‘scientist’ with his white coat and his frazzled hair. But he’s no talking head. His group developed CORBEVAX, a patent-free COVID-19 vaccine that just might help to vaccinate the world.\nHuddled around that small conference table in 2018, Peter told us that scientists need to recognize their role—our role—in fighting against the troubling rise of vaccine skeptics and science denialism. This was about two years before COVID, so Peter was largely speaking about the return of measles in the US and the damage done by a famously retracted paper about 8 children in the UK that falsely linked the MMR vaccine to autism.\nI found his talk engaging, but I didn’t recognize the urgency of his message at the time. COVID changed that.\nFast-forward to March of 2020, and we all found ourselves at home, watching a horrific scene unfold in Italy, many of us still in denial that our lives would be impacted beyond a temporary inconvenience. Any hope of being spared vanished as the virus took hold in the United States; 700 people were dying every day in New York City alone come April.\nIt was around this time that scientists like Peter began making regular appearances on TV, trying to explain the science of viral transmission and vaccines. While our leaders in Washington tried to distract us from the severity of the moment—calling it the flu and hyping bogus treatments like hydroxychloroquine—scientists like Peter, one of the few coronavirus researchers in the country at the time, tried to set the record straight.\nInitially we welcomed these voices into our homes, but a vocal opposition to science, vaccines, and masks was getting louder. I recently asked Peter when public sentiment changed, and he said it was when the Delta variant swept through the southern US, killing thousands, predominantly the unvaccinated. Vaccines had just become widely available and a new threat was emerging: the political polarization of science.\nSince the early 1970’s, the General Social Survey, a nationally representative survey of adults in the US, has monitored trends in public opinion. For most of the last 50 years, about 4 in 10 adults said they had a “great deal” of confidence in the scientific community. That’s not great, but there was never much daylight on this issue between Democrats and Republicans.\nBefore 2019, the biggest gap between Democrats and Republicans was 11 percentage points, back in the Reagan era when Republican support for science trumped Democrats’. Today the gap is 35 percentage points, with two-thirds of Democrats expressing strong confidence in the scientific community.\nDo you know what other gap is about 35 percentage points? The prevalence of COVID vaccination by political affiliation. In some parts of the country this past year, horse dewormers, not vaccines, were flying off the shelf.\nWhere did we go wrong? Our biomedical colleagues developed a highly efficacious and safe vaccine in record time. This should have been a victory lap for science. Ticker tape parades, scientists on cereal boxes.\nInstead, scientists and science advocates have been harassed and bullied, even called Nazis. Many people died or wound up in the hospital who could have been spared. Insufficient vaccination coverage pushed our health system to the brink and extended disruptions for schools and businesses.\nThe political polarization of science has cost us dearly over the past year, but COVID will not be the end of it. The effects of climate change could be much more devastating, and the extent to which people believe in the need to act can largely be predicted by political affiliation.\nThis is depressing stuff, I know, I’m a hit at parties, but I will leave you with some good news: You’re ready to confront these challenges.\nYou might recall from class that I had two goals for your learning: to make you better consumers of research and to prepare you to contribute to research teams.\nWe need your critical thinking skills and your understanding of science to break through the noise polluting today’s discourse. I know that many of you will not decide to pursue research careers, but you will all be lifelong consumers of research and you will impact those around you. You’ll influence what your friends and families think about vaccines. You’ll lead companies, manage people, and set policies. You’ll represent your communities in Congress, practice medicine, and argue before the highest courts in the land. You’ll communicate science to a polarized public. I believe you would call this “becoming an influencer”, just without the brand deals. People will listen, you just have to speak up. We need you to help build trust in science from the outside.\nOthers in this room will help build trust in science from the inside, as researchers. You’re the most transparent generation—believe me, I’ve seen TikTok—and you’ll use your values to make science more open. You’re inheriting an uncertain world, and you know that science, like society, is not black and white, but gray and full of uncertainty. You’ll help us move beyond our obsession with novel, counter-intuitive results and journal prestige to focus on what matters—good science. The reformers of the past decade have largely been early career scientists. You are ready to follow in their footsteps.\nListen, I’m a pessimist most weeks of the year, but days like today remind me that help is coming.\nI want to conclude by speaking to our guests today. Let me tell you, I am so proud of your kids. The past few years tested them. They left for spring break as sophomores did not come back. Those who returned in the fall found a campus that was hard to recognize. But they adapted. I asked them to join me for class in the baseball stadium, and they said, “OK”. I asked them to join me for Zoom office hours, and they said, “OK”. I said, “please do this assignment on time”, and they said, “no thank you”. Let’s just say we all had a bit of adapting to do.\nI’m proud of them, and I know you are too. So please join me in giving them a round of applause."

    "text": "A clearly stated research question and a strong team motivated to get answers are the building blocks of success in global health research. The same could probably be said about most research domains, but I’ll argue that meaningful and effective collaborations are uniquely essential to global health. They’re so important that I’ve chosen to slot the chapter on collaborations ahead of the chapter on research questions. I did this to emphasize an ideal order of operations that starts with team formation before proceeding to collaborative framing of the research problem and question.\nBefore discussing collaborations, however, we need to establish a shared understanding of what we mean by ‘global health research’. That’s where we’ll start."

    "section": "1.1 What is Global Health?",
    "text": "1.1 What is Global Health?\nNew York County Courthouse, Lower Manhattan, New York City, circa 2009\nJudge presiding over jury selection: And what do you do, Mr. Green?\nMe: Global health research.\nJudge:\nMe: I study access to mental health services.\nJudge: So health policy then?\nMe: No, mostly intervention research.\nJudge: Globally.\nMe: No, not quite.\nJudge: What is global health, Mr. Green?\nMe: Well, you see…rambles…\nJudge: Thank you, Mr. Green. You are dismissed.\nI’ve had this conversation hundreds of times since that court appearance. Now when asked, I say something like, “global health takes a global perspective on public health problems,” drawing inspiration from Skolnik (2019). In the wake of the pandemic, I find that people nod along at this framing. It makes sense to them. Thanks, COVID-19!\n\nSkolnik, R. (2019). Global health 101, fourth edition. Jones & Bartlett Learning.\n\nMerson, M. H. et al. (2018). Global health: Diseases, programs, systems, and policies (4th ed.). Jones & Bartlett Learning.\n\nKoplan, J. P. et al. (2009). Towards a common definition of global health. The Lancet, 373(9679), 1993–1995.\nGo any deeper below the ontological surface, however, and you’ll find that there is not a consensus definition of global health (Merson et al., 2018). We’ll adopt this one from Koplan et al. (2009):\n\nGlobal health is an area for study, research, and practice that places a priority on improving health and achieving equity in health for all people worldwide. Global health emphasizes transnational health issues, determinants, and solutions; involves many disciplines within and beyond the health sciences and promotes interdisciplinary collaboration; and is a synthesis of population-based prevention with individual-level clinical care.\n\nTake note of two key elements of their definition:\n\nit includes scholars, researchers, and practitioners working across disciplinary boundaries; and\nit goes beyond simply improving health to include the goal of achieving health equity.\n\nTo expand on the first point, this definition reflects the reality that global health challenges are complex, so the search for solutions must span disciplines. In the study of malaria, for example, you can read about the spread of the disease (epidemiology), the impact of illness on future productivity (economics), the merits of free or subsidized bed nets (public policy), mosquito habitats (ecology), the efficacy of vaccines to prevent the disease (medicine and statistics), rapid diagnostic tests (biomedical engineering), and the adoption and use of bed nets (psychology), just to name a few areas of inquiry.\nThe second point is that global health is action-oriented, seeking to achieve health equity for all people worldwide. The WHO (2021) defines equity as follows:\n\nWHO. (2021). Health Equity.\n\nEquity is the absence of unfair, avoidable or remediable differences among groups of people, whether those groups are defined socially, economically, demographically, or geographically or by other dimensions of inequality (e.g. sex, gender, ethnicity, disability, or sexual orientation). Health is a fundamental human right. Health equity is achieved when everyone can attain their full potential for health and well-being.\n\nPut another way, health inequities are unfair and unjust differences in healthcare access or health outcomes that can be prevented or fixed. Health inequities are structural, often resulting from decisions we make about who gets access to resources.\nThe consequence of inequity is often inequality. For instance, inequitable access to healthcare services can lead to unequal health outcomes—health inequalities—between groups. Differences in health status are also referred to as health disparities.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has given us many examples of health inequities and disparities. For instance, data compiled by the website Health Inequities Tracker, visualized in Figure 1.1, show that through at least August 2021, Hispanics and Latinos in the United States were over-represented in COVID-19 hospitalizations, while non-Hispanic Whites were substantially under-represented (Satcher Health Leadership Institute, 2021).\n\nSatcher Health Leadership Institute. (2021). Health Equity Tracker.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: COVID-19 health disparities.\n\n\n\nMacias Gil et al. (2020) point to several factors that might help to explain why Latinos and Hispanics were disproportionately affected by COVID-19:\n\nMacias Gil, R. et al. (2020). COVID-19 pandemic: Disparate health impact on the hispanic/latinx population in the united states. The Journal of Infectious Diseases, 222(10), 1592–1595.\n\nHigher rates of co-morbid health conditions\nMore likely to be underinsured or uninsured\nUndocumented immigration status\nLanguage barriers to accessing services\nOverrepresentation in “essential” jobs where working from home was not possible\nGreater financial pressures to show up to work, even if unwell or potentially exposed to the virus\nMore likely to live in multigenerational homes where transmission was more likely\n\nSeveral of these underlying factors, such as undocumented immigration status, fall into the category of social determinants of health (WHO, 2013).\n\nWHO. (2013). Social determinants of health: Key concepts.\n\nThe circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, work and age, and the systems put in place to deal with illness.\n\nConsider the directed acyclic graph, or DAG, in Figure 1.2 that illustrates how social determinants of health might have influenced the pandemic. I’ll introduce DAGs in more detail in a later chapter, so for now think of this as a (simplified) hypothesized conceptual model of what precipitates COVID-19 infection and hospitalization.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Based on Nafilyan et al. (2021).\nNafilyan, V. et al. (2021). Occupation and COVID-19 mortality in England: A national linked data study of 14.3 million adults. medRxiv.\n\n\n\n\nAs represented in this DAG, hospitalization with COVID-19 is directly caused by infection with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, but who gets infected is not completely random. Infectious diseases are social affairs, and some people are more vulnerable because of their context. For instance, vaccinated individuals are less likely to get infected, and vaccination rates are highest in the U.S. among the most educated. Looking further back in the causal chain, educational attainment is highest among groups without historical social inequities such as systematic racism.\nA diagram like this suggests that to prevent future pandemics we need to gain a deeper understanding of the interaction between social determinants of health and disease risk. More importantly, it implies that we have work to do to fix the underlying societal inequities that make certain groups more vulnerable. As we’ve seen with COVID-19, technological solutions alone—like developing a vaccine in record time—may not be sufficient.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Global access to COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\n\nSirleaf, E. J. et al. (2021). Achieving vaccination justice: A call for global cooperation. PLOS Global Public Health, 1(10), 1–3.\nAnother example of a COVID-19 inequity is global access to vaccines (see Figure 1.2). By October 2021, nearly half of the world’s population had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but the first 6.5 billion doses mostly went into the arms of citizens of wealthy countries. Less than 3 percent of people in low-income countries had received even one dose. While true that many low-income countries escaped the worst of the pandemic’s first few waves, the glacial roll out of vaccines globally—what some have decried as a vaccine apartheid—leaves many nations vulnerable to deadly new variants. This puts everyone at risk. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Helen Clark, the former heads of Liberia and New Zealand, respectively, state this plainly in the inaugural issue of PLOS Global Public Health (Sirleaf et al., 2021):\n\nAchieving vaccination justice is the first great test of this pandemic era—it requires targets and aspirations for vaccine access to be determined by health criteria not a country’s economic status, and timely delivery not a two-speed world where high-income populations are fully immunized within months but the poor are denied access for years. Meeting the vaccine justice test will signal that we have both understood the interdependence that determines our planetary future and have the capacity to act on it. Failing the test will condemn us to a ‘forever crisis’ of insecurity and recrimination as virus variants are given free rein and new vaccines struggle to keep up."

    "section": "1.2 What is Research?",
    "text": "1.2 What is Research?\n\n\n\nThis definition comes from Title 45 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46, Subpart A, also known as the Common Rule.\n\nResearch is a systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. Let’s break down this definition.\n\nResearch is systematic in that it follows a documented and repeatable methodology.\nInvestigations include research development, testing, and evaluation.\nBy generalizable knowledge, we mean that the investigation intends to advance our scientific understanding. The goal is to go beyond the collection of facts about a particular sample and make conclusions that have relevance for other scholars, practitioners, or policymakers.\n\nFor instance, you might interview parents of young children about their use of mosquito nets. You intend to analyze the transcripts and develop new ideas about the barriers to bed net use that you hope to publish in an academic journal. Other scholars will read this work use it to develop new theories of health behavior and create new interventions that promote bed net use. This is research.\nBut what if a journalist wants to write a feature article about the burden of malaria and interviews a few of the same parents? Is this research?\n\n\nThe Common Rule definition of research excludes journalism activities, public health surveillance activities in support of an order from a public health agency, criminal justice investigations, and operational activities related to national security.\nNo.\nFor one, the journalist might not follow a systematic method for deciding which parents to approach, how to conduct the interviews, or how to synthesize what they learn. Second, the journalist has a different objective. Whereas you wanted to systematically advance our understanding of barriers to bed net use—insights that might apply to different parents in other settings—the journalist intends to inform the public by telling the stories of a few specific parents.\nAnother way that a study can advance scientific understanding is by developing and testing scientific methods and procedures. For instance, a research team might plan a small pilot test to collect initial data that will inform the design of a larger study. In most cases, we’d consider these pre-study activities to be research—even if the team does not intend to publish the results—because the pilot study is part of the knowledge generation process.\nBut here again, intent matters. Let’s say Facebook randomly assigns a small percentage of its users to receive email campaign A or campaign B and tracks which campaign generates the most clicks or sales. The company’s objective in this case is to determine which campaign optimizes their marketing spend for conversions, not to say something more general about human perception and behavior. Therefore, it’s not considered research.\nAs we’ll discuss in a later chapter, it’s always a good idea to consult with an Institutional Review Board to determine if your proposed work is considered research (and if it is, whether it falls under policies requiring ethical review)."

    "section": "1.3 What Makes Research Scientific?",
    "text": "1.3 What Makes Research Scientific?\nWhether you’re designing a study that relies on qualitative methods, quantitative methods, or a blend of both, there are several main characteristics of scientific research that apply to global health (King et al., 2021; Leary, 2012):\n\nKing, G. et al. (2021). Designing Social Inquiry: Scientific Inference in Qualitative Research, New Edition. Princeton University Press.\n\nLeary, M. (2012). Introduction to behavioral research methods (6th ed.). Pearson.\n\nthe approach is empirical;\nthe procedures are public;\nthe goal is inference; and\nthe conclusions are uncertain.\n\n\nTHE APPROACH IS EMPIRICAL\n\n\nPeople often ask me questions that, at least in theory, can be answered with data, but I don’t know the answers. In these situations, I like to remove my glasses, stare into middle distance, and say, “That’s an interesting empirical question”. It means, “I don’t know. We should collect some data.”\nScience is built on systematic data collection. That’s what makes it an empirical endeavor. Expert opinion is a form of evidence, but it’s not empirical evidence. Empirical evidence comes from systematic observation, and the method of observation can be quantitative or qualitative. Contrary to what some people believe, empirical is not a synonym for quantitative.\n\n\nTHE PROCEDURES ARE PUBLIC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA poorly documented Method section. Source: Internet meme, unknown author.\n\n\n\nScientific research uses public methods that can be examined and replicated. A Method section in a scientific paper is like a recipe. If you’ve ever tried to follow a confusing recipe, you can appreciate the importance of good documentation. Your study’s recipe must be clear (well written), thorough (no ‘dash’ of this or that), and shared publicly (not a secret passed down to lab members).\nWe care about complete and transparent reporting in science for several reasons. First, as consumers of research, we rely on authors’ descriptions of their empirical methods to come to our own conclusions about the findings. If research colleagues cannot inspect your methods, they will have little reason to trust your results. Second, no one study should ever rule the day. If the results of your study are robust, another research group should be able to follow the recipe and replicate the findings. When such findings are replicated, we all have more confidence in the results. Third, sharing your methods makes scientific progress possible.\n\n\nTHE GOAL IS INFERENCE\nEmpiricism is essential to science, but science is more than observation. To create generalizable knowledge, you need data and inference. There are two broad categories of inference: (a) descriptive inference and (b) causal inference.\nDescriptive inference is using the data we observe to make conclusions about that which we don’t or can’t observe directly. For instance, you might survey 200 people about their health beliefs, but your real aim is to make conclusions about the broader group. You use the data you have from 200 people to make this inference.\nCausal inference involves a different mental leap where we ask “what if” to make conclusions about causes and effects. Consider the case where we want to know which pill works better to resolve an illness, the red one or the blue one. The fundamental challenge to getting an answer is that we can’t give someone both pills simultaneously. An individual can only take one pill at a time. In this situation we might be able to randomly assign people to each type of pill as a tool for making a causal inference. But frequently, random assignment isn’t possible and we have to use other strategies for asking “what if”.\n\n\nTHE CONCLUSIONS ARE UNCERTAIN\nEvery method has limitations, every measurement has error, and every model is wrong to some extent. Take the estimation of maternal mortality rates as an example. Hogan published estimates for 181 countries (Hogan et al., 2010). Some countries, such as the United States, have vast amounts of data in vital registries that attempt to track all births and deaths. It’s not perfect, so we still estimate the maternal mortality rate using a statistical model.\n\nHogan, M. C. et al. (2010). Maternal mortality for 181 countries, 1980–2008: A systematic analysis of progress towards millennium development goal 5. The Lancet, 375(9726), 1609–1623.\n\n\n\nThis is still several hundred mostly preventable deaths per year. Currently in the U.S., the rate of maternal mortality among non-hispanic Black women is at least 2.5 times higher than the rate for non-hispanic White women.\n\nAs you can see in the left panel of Figure 1.4, the United States has a (relatively) low level of maternal mortality, between about 10-20 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live child births. Compared to some countries, the US has a lot of data points for estimating the level and trend in maternal deaths, so the uncertainty band is narrow.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Estimates of the maternal mortality rate in the United States and Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nNow take a look at Afghanistan on the right. Note that the y-axis scale is much larger in the 1000s, reflecting the fact that many more Afghan women die of causes related to pregnancy or childbirth. Next, pay attention to the width of the uncertainty band. It spans a range of more than 3000 deaths. Compare this to a range of fewer than 5 deaths in the US! This is because there are very few data points available to estimate the ‘true’ value in Afghanistan, and these individual data points can differ by more than 1000 deaths.\nThe takeaway message is that there is uncertainty in everything. No single estimate can be considered the answer. Embrace uncertainty and you will become a better scientist."

    "section": "1.4 What Constitutes Global Health Research?",
    "text": "1.4 What Constitutes Global Health Research?\nGlobal health research brings together scholars and practitioners from many different disciplines to tackle big challenges. Therefore, the methods of these disciplines are the methods of global health research. We can organize the research landscape as shown in Figure 1.8.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: A research taxonomy.\n\n\n\nResearch is divided into two main categories: basic and applied. Overlapping with applied research is an area of work called “monitoring and evaluation”, or M&E. Let’s examine what constitutes research before turning to M&E.\n\nBASIC RESEARCH\n\n\nBasic research is sometimes referred to as the ‘bench’ in the ‘bench to bedside’ cascade of research needed to take an idea from the lab to a new medical treatment. This is accurate but incomplete. Fields like psychology also conduct basic research into constructs like emotion and violence that seek to expand our understanding. This is not ‘bench science’ as typically imagined, but it’s basic research nonetheless.\nBasic research—also known as “pure” or “blue skies” research—is the pursuit of fundamental knowledge of phenomena. For example, scientists conduct laboratory experiments to understand the parasitic life cycle and how parasites interact with humans at different stages. Another example is the scientific investigation of the properties of cancer cells to better understand how they grow and spread.\nThe information generated by basic science becomes the basis for applied science. Harvard neurobiologist Dr. Rachel Wilson explains this beautifully:\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Dr. Wilson’s full remarks.\n\n\nThe new therapies of today were the prototypes of yesterday. And the prototypes of yesterday were previously just findings in laboratories, and before that they were just an idea. Unless we have new ideas, we’re not going to have useful therapies. Great new therapies don’t just fall like apples from a tree.\n\n\n\nAPPLIED RESEARCH\nApplied research focuses on specific problems or real-world applications. Much of global health research falls into the applied domain because our mission is to improve health and achieve equity in health for all people worldwide.\n\nClinical Research\nApplied science takes many different forms, including clinical research. Clinical research is a broad field that aims to understand human disease, develop better ways to detect, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease, and to promote health (Roundtable et al., 2002). Table 1.1 lists several domains of clinical research.\n\nRoundtable, I. of M. (US). C. R. et al. (2002). Definitions of Clinical Research and Components of the Enterprise. National Academies Press (US).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.1:  Different types of clinical research \n \n  \n    Domain \n    Description \n  \n \n\n  \n    Treatment/prevention research \n    Test new approaches for preventing or treating illness; includes clinical trials of drugs, biologics, devices, instruments, and behavioral interventions \n  \n  \n    Screening research \n    Develop and evaluate methods for detecting illness risk factors or markers \n  \n  \n    Diagnostic research \n    Develop and evaluate methods for identifying health conditions or illness \n  \n  \n    Genetic studies \n    Examine links between genes and disorders \n  \n  \n    Epidemiological studies \n    Study the patterns, causes, prevalence, and incidence of disease in a population \n  \n  \n    Health services research \n    Study how people access healthcare services, healthcare costs, and outcomes; operations research \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese phases are broadly similar across different regulatory bodies around the world, including the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization in India, and the National Medical Products Administration in China, among many others. Here’s a brief overview of the phases from the NIH’s National Cancer Institute.\n\nOne type of clinical research is a clinical trial. Table 1.2 lists the phases of trials that drugs, biologics, devices, and instruments complete prior to going to market. In the early phases of drug trials, the objective is to understand how the compound affects the body. What is a safe dose that could be effective? Phase 3 trials put the optimal dose to the test, seeking to determine if the drug “works” and to quantify the size of the effect. Drugs that pass this test are typically approved for use by the governing regulatory body. Once a drug reaches market, Phase 4 trials monitor side effects and efficacy over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.2:  Clinical trial phases \n \n  \n    Phase \n    Enrollment \n    Goal \n  \n \n\n  \n    Preclinical research \n     \n    Are there signs that the drug candidate will have an effect in the lab? \n  \n  \n    0 \n    <10 \n    What happens in the body (pharmacokinetics) when a very low dose is administered to human subjects? (optional phase) \n  \n  \n    1 \n    10s \n    Is the drug safe? What is the best dose that balances possible effects with toxicity? \n  \n  \n    2 \n    100s \n    When using this optimal dose, is there any effect of the drug on clinical markers or health outcomes? \n  \n  \n    3 \n    1000s \n    What is the effect of the drug on clinical markers or health outcomes when compared to an existing treatment or placebo in a randomized evaluation? Success at this stage is required for regulatory approval in some countries. \n  \n  \n    4 \n     \n    Are there long-term adverse effects of the drug once it is available on the market? \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to see a list of international trial registries.\n\nIn the United States, the FDA requires that most interventional studies of any regulated products with research sites in the U.S. be registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov trial registry (Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, n.d.). Many countries have their own registries, and the World Health Organization maintains a web portal that searches across registries.\n\nFood and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. (n.d.). Pub. L. No. 110-85, 121 Stat. 904 (2007).\n\n\n\nClick here to read about Aunt Debbie’s experience in a Phase 1 poliovirus trial at Duke University.\n\nTrial registries are useful for researchers and patients alike. When my wife’s Aunt Debbie learned she had an aggressive brain tumor, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov and identified several trials recruiting patients for experimental glioblastoma treatments. Debbie decided to take part in a Phase 1 trial that injected modified poliovirus into her tumor. She lived for another five years and helped to advance the science of glioblastoma treatment.\nHealthy volunteers and patients like Debbie are the backbone of clinical research. Their sacrifices, combined with the ingenuity of scientists and research teams, have created thousands of medical breakthroughs. But for every new drug approved, there is a trail of failure (see Figure 1.6). Recent studies estimate that fewer than 15% of candidates entering Phase 1 trials are ultimately approved by the FDA (Wong et al., 2019).\n\nWong, C. H. et al. (2019). Estimation of clinical trial success rates and related parameters. Biostatistics, 20(2), 273–286.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Pipeline from basic research to FDA approval.\n\n\n\nThis pipeline does not include studies of behavioral interventions, social programs, or policies because the FDA only regulates drugs, biologics, devices, and instruments. Nevertheless, we still design studies to estimate the efficacy of interventions, programs, and policies, and many of these tests meet the World Health Organization’s definition of a ‘clinical trial’ (WHO, 2020):\n\nWHO. (2020). Clinical trials.\n\nThe International Committee of Medical Journal Editors adopted this definition in 2007 and recommended that all clinical trials should be registered in an appropriate trial registry. Many peer-reviewed health journals follow this guidance and will not accept manuscripts from unregistered studies.\n\n\nany research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes. (World Health Organization definition)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Pedro Alonso from the World Health Organization explains why this vaccine is a breakthrough in the prevention of malaria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCASE STUDY: Developing the first malaria vaccine\n\n\n\nIn 2021, after more than 35 years of research, the World Health Organization recommended widespread use of a vaccine candidate called RTS,S/AS01, or Mosquirix™, to prevent P. falciparum malaria in children.\nDevelopment of RTS,S/AS01 began in 1984, and soon after, a promising vaccine candidate entered preclinical research. Researchers performed tests on nonhuman subjects to collect data on how well the vaccine worked (efficacy), how much damage it could do to an organism (toxicity), and how the body affected the vaccine (pharmacokinetics).\nClinical research on humans began in 1992. Researchers conducted a Phase 1 safety and immunogenicity trial with 20 adults in The Gambia in 1997. Results suggested that the vaccine did not have any significant toxicity but did produce the expected antibodies.\nSeveral Phase 2 studies conducted over the next decade demonstrated the efficacy of the vaccine against several endpoints. A Phase 2b trial began in Mozambique in 2003 with more than 2,000 children. Each child was randomly assigned to receive 3 doses of RTS,S or a control vaccine. After 6 months, the prevalence of malaria was 37% lower in the treatment group than in the control group. This Phase 2 trial was an important proof-of-concept study.\nThe results of a large Phase 3 trial with more than 15,000 infants and young children in 7 African countries were published in 2015. Children who participated in the study were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 arms: (i) 3 doses of RTS,S and a booster dose at month 20, (ii) 3 doses of RTS,S and a booster dose of a comparator vaccine at month 20, or (iii) 4 doses of a comparator vaccine. RTS,S reduced clinical malaria cases by 28% and 18% among young children and infants, respectively, over a 3 to 4-year period. This Phase 3 trial demonstrated that the treatment was efficacious.\nOn the basis of these results, the European Medicines Agency issued a favorable “European scientific opinion”. This led the health ministries in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi to authorize a pilot study in 2019 to assess the feasibility of administering the required four doses of the vaccine as part of routine childhood immunization programs. After more than 800,000 children were immunized under this program, the WHO recommended that countries with moderate to high transmission adopt the vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\nTranslational, Implementation, and Policy Research\n\n\n\nBauer and Kirchner make the point that our failure to put good ideas to use is not a new phenonmenon. The British Navy observed in 1601 that citrus cured scurvy on long sea voyages—and collected confirming ‘trial’ evidence in 1747—but it was not until 1795 that using citrus became routine practice.\n\nIt’s a long road from idea to impact (Morris et al., 2011), and most ideas don’t complete the trip (Bauer et al., 2020). Practitioners of translational research point to four key bottlenecks where ideas often stall (see also Figure 1.8):\n\nMorris, Z. S. et al. (2011). The answer is 17 years, what is the question: Understanding time lags in translational research. Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, 104(12), 510–520.\n\nBauer, M. S. et al. (2020). Implementation science: What is it and why should I care? Psychiatry Research, 283, 112376.\n\nT1: Translation from basic science to clinical research\nT2: Translation from early clinical trials to Phase 3 trials and beyond with larger patient populations\nT3: Translation from efficacy trials (i.e., Phase 3 trials) to real-world effectiveness through implementation research\nT4: Translation from evidence about delivery at scale to the adoption of new policies\n\nTranslational research originally focused on moving from “bench to bedside”, or from basic research in the lab to clinical research with humans (T1), and later expanded to address the challenge of moving from early to late-stage human trials (T2). Today we recognize that other bottlenecks (T3 and T4) prevent good ideas from impacting population health and policy (Woolf, 2008).\n\nWoolf, S. H. (2008).

In Our World in Data.\nFor instance, we know that giving children a simple mixture of water, sugar, and salts when they are dehydrated from diarrhea can prevent death in 90% of cases, but only 4 in 10 children receive this life saving oral rehydration therapy [ORT; Dadonaite (2019)]. And each year, several hundred thousand children under five years die from diarrheal diseases.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Time from introduction to achievement of public health coverage targets. Source: AVAC Report 2017: Mixed Messages and How to Untangle Them. avac.org/report2017.\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a ‘delivery gap’ or ‘know-do’ gap in global health—the space between discovering what works and delivering the solution at scale (see Figure 1.7 for other examples).\n\n\nWork in this area has evolved independently across several disciplines. In addition to translational research and implementation research, you can find references to dissemination science, diffusion of innovations, quality improvement, knowledge transfer, and learning healthcare systems.\n\nKruk, M. E. et al. (2016). Transforming Global Health by Improving the Science of Scale-Up. PLOS Biology, 14(3), e1002360.\nPolicy and implementation research, or PIR, aims to close these gaps. PIR is the science of scale up (Kruk et al., 2016). It combines implementation research with health policy and systems research.\nImplementation research is the study of strategies for expanding the reach and coverage of tested ideas to improve population health. A common scenario is where intervention research demonstrates that a treatment is efficacious, such as ORT, but take-up is low and slow, thus limiting its impact. The implementation research question is how to best promote its use.\n\n\n\nHow is implementation science different from implementation research? Implementation science develops the frameworks and methods that are used in implementation research. Click here to watch an introductory workshop on implementation science from Northwestern University.\n\nHealth policy and systems research shares the same goal of population impact but takes an even broader view of the systemic and policy factors that can hinder or facilitate scale-up. Take for example a retrospective analysis by Lam et al. that evaluated the impact of policymaking in Uganda on ORT and zinc coverage (Lam et al., 2019). The authors triangulated data from various sources on government actions, distribution of supplies, and treatment with ORT, and estimated that the proportion of young children with diarrhea who received ORT increased 30-fold between 2011 and 2016, from 1% to 30%. Their policy analysis concluded that government actions likely made the difference.\n\nLam, F. et al. (2019). A retrospective mixed-methods evaluation of a national ORS and zinc scale-up program in Uganda between 2011 and 2016. Journal of Global Health, 9(1), 010504.\n\n\n\nMONITORING AND EVALUATION\nAnother area of applied work in global health is monitoring and evaluation (M&E), also known as program evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomist and 2019 Nobel laureate Dr. Ester Duflo made a similar argument three decades after Campbell in a great TED Talk on social experiments to fight poverty.\n\n\nEvaluation\nProgram evaluation became commonplace in the United States by the end of the 1950s and grew dramatically in the 1960s as the federal government expanded and introduced new social programs. Lawmakers wanted accountability, and the evaluation of social programs took off (Rossi et al., 2003). But is program evaluation really research?\n\nCampbell, D. T. (1969). Reforms as experiments. American Psychologist, 24(4), 409.\nMethods giant Donald Campbell thought so (Campbell, 1969):\n\nThe United States…should be ready for an experimental approach to social reform, an approach in which we try out new programs designed to cure specific problems, in which we learn whether or not these programs are effective, and in which we retain, imitate, modify or discard them on the basis of their effectiveness on the multiple imperfect criteria available.\n\nBut not everyone agrees. Some have argued that program evaluation is really designed for program implementers and funders, and that the messy nature of program implementation requires a loosening of research standards (Cronbach, 1982).\n\nCronbach, L. J. (1982). Designing evaluations of educational and social programs. Jossey-Bass.\n\nRossi, P. H. et al. (2003). Evaluation: A systematic approach. Sage Publications.\nIn their introductory text on evaluation, Rossi et al. (2003) strike a balance in views on this question of whether program evaluation is research. Their answer is perhaps a bit unsatisfying but is arguably true nevertheless: It depends. In essence, program evaluations should be as rigorous as logistics, ethics, politics, and resources permit—and no less. Some evaluations are more rigorous than others and will meet the definition of research (a systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge). For this reason, in Figure 1.8 I represent Monitoring & Evaluation as a block that intersects applied research but extends outside the research boundary.\n\nImpact Evaluations\n\n\n\n\n\nA clinical trialist who conducts RCTs for a living is unlikely to refer to a clinical trial as an ‘impact evaluation’, even though an RCT is a type of impact evaluation. This language is more commonly used by economists and others who study the impact of social sector programs and interventions. This video from the World Bank introduces impact evaluations.\n\nEvaluations can take different forms and serve various purposes. A subset of both applied research and program evaluation is the impact evaluation. An impact evaluation is a study that aims to quantify the causal effect—or impact—of a program or policy on some outcome of interest. There are several research designs that can generate evidence of impact. One example is the randomized controlled trial, or RCT, a mainstay of Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. Not all impact evaluations use random assignment to make causal inferences, but they all share the goal of making a cause-and-effect claim. As we’ll see in later chapters, the strength of this claim rests on the assumptions of the particular research design.\n\n\n\nMonitoring\nProgram monitoring is concerned with documenting the implementation of programs and interventions. How are resources being used? How many people participate? Does the program reach the intended targets? Not all programs are evaluated (“do they work?”), but most are monitored (“what happened?”) to some degree for accountability to funders. Researchers can use monitoring data to document participants’ exposure to the program and to conduct economic analyses related to program costs and impacts.\nA related activity is the process evaluation. A process evaluation goes beyond monitoring counts and tallies, largely an administrative task, to ask if a program is being delivered as intended. This gets at the question of fidelity of the implementation to the original design. Process evaluations are essential for impact evaluations: If a program fails to show an impact, the next question is why? Did the program fail because the idea or theory behind the program was wrong (theory failure)? Or was the implementation of the program so troubled that there was never a chance for success (implementation failure)?"

    "text": "1.5 Who Funds Global Health Research?\n\n\nAccording to Micah et al., “Development assistance for health refers to the financial and non-financial resources that are disbursed through international development agencies to maintain or improve health in low-income and middle-income countries.”\n\nMicah, A. E. et al. (2021). Tracking development assistance for health and for COVID-19: A review of development assistance, government, out-of-pocket, and other private spending on health for 204 countries and territories, 1990–2050. The Lancet, 398(10308), 1317–1343.\nBillions of dollars are spent on global health priorities every year. For instance, the international community disbursed $35-40 billion in development assistance for health yearly from 2010 to 2019. In 2020 this figure jumped to $55 billion because of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the United States accounting for one-quarter of the 2020 total ($14 billion) (Micah et al., 2021). Since the mid-2000s, most of this money has flowed to infectious disease programs (Figure @fig-funding).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: Development assistance for health by health focus area, 1990 to 2000.\n\n\n\nDevelopment assistance for health includes funded research, but it’s not inclusive of all research in low- and middle-income countries (e.g., does not include domestic spending on research). Nor does it capture research on global health issues in wealthy nations. Inequities in health exist everywhere, so by definition global health research is a broad domain. It’s difficult to put a dollar amount on the enterprise as a whole. A 2013 analysis estimated that the global investment in health research and development (R&D) topped $300 billion (in 2021 dollars) (Røttingen et al., 2013).\n\nRøttingen, J.-A. et al. (2013). Mapping of available health research and development data: What’s there, what’s missing, and what role is there for a global observatory? Lancet (London, England), 382(9900), 1286–1307.\n\nPolicy Cures Research. (n.d.). G-FINDER data portal.\nAccording to this analysis, most investments in health R&D come from private industry (60%), with the rest coming from the public sector (30%) and other sources (10%). Very little money is directed to pharmaceutical products and technologies for global health priorities that disproportionately affect poor countries—less than $4 billion in 2019 (Policy Cures Research, n.d.). In this 2019 accounting, public and philanthropic funders provided almost 90% of the money. The two leading funders were the United States National Institutes of Health (44%) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (16%), contributing nearly two-thirds of all research dollars between them.\nThe model for investments in R&D for health is funding from the rich, to the rich, (mostly) for the rich."

    "text": "1.6 Who Sets the Agenda and Conducts Global Health Research?\nThis is important context because funders have an outsized role in setting the research agenda (Sridhar, 2012). Outside of industry, researchers depend primarily on grants to fund their work. As nearly all global health research funding comes from governments and philanthropies in high-income countries, the global health research agenda is set in large part by the wealthy (Ii et al., 2018).\n\nSridhar, D.

In-country researchers too often only play the role of partner or collaborator, rather than principal investigator, if even consulted (Kyobutungi et al., 2021). We’ll revisit these power imbalances, and what can be done to chart a more equitable and inclusive course for global health research, in the next chapter."

    "text": "2.1 Decolonizing Global Health\nToday’s global health emphasizes equity in healthcare access and health outcomes, but we can trace some of its lineage back through international health and tropical medicine to European colonization and ‘colonial medicine’—back to a time when the motivation was protecting colonial rulers and promoting national interests, not equity (Holst, 2020). Global health has come a long way since then—as has the health and wellbeing of people everywhere—but some argue that our approach to collaboration in global health has not fully parted ways with its colonial influences (Abimbola et al., 2020).\n\nHolst, J. (2020). Global health–emergence, hegemonic trends and biomedical reductionism. Globalization and Health, 16(1), 1–11.\n\nAbimbola, S. et al. (2020). Will global health survive its decolonisation?

(2021). PLOS Global Public Health, charting a new path towards equity, diversity and inclusion in global health. PLOS Global Public Health, 1(10), e0000038.\nThis is because many collaborations in global health have been, and continue to be, an unequal venture, not a true partnership. In the previous chapter, I noted that the global health research agenda is, in large part, set and carried out by the wealthy. Less than 1% of funding for biomedical research goes directly to scientists in low-income countries (WHO, n.d.), and consequently, authors from the Global North are overrepresented in scientific publications (Kyobutungi et al., 2021).\nCalls to ‘decolonize’ global health are not new (Costello et al., 2000), but we’ve witnessed a new urgency in recent years, with students and trainees often leading the way. There is a compelling argument that says the only path to decolonization is radical transformation of institutions (Hirsch, 2021); efforts to improve diversity and inclusion are welcome, but they are not a substitute for dismantling a system that was designed to benefit those with power (Pai, n.d.). Abimbola and Pai frame the aims of the decolonize global health movement as follows:\n\nCostello, A. et al. (2000). Moving to research partnerships in developing countries. Bmj, 321(7264), 827–829.\n\nHirsch, L. A. (2021). Is it possible to decolonise global health institutions? Lancet, 397(10270), 189–190.\n\nPai, M. (n.d.). Decolonizing Global Health: A Moment To Reflect On A Movement. In Forbes.\n\nTo decolonise global health is to remove all forms of supremacy within all spaces of global health practice, within countries, between countries, and at the global level. Supremacy is not restricted to White supremacy or male domination. It concerns what happens not only between people from HICs and LMICs but also what happens between groups and individuals within HICs and within LMICs. Supremacy is there, glaringly, in how global health organisations operate, who runs them, where they are located, who holds the purse strings, who sets the agenda, and whose views, histories, and knowledge are taken seriously.\n\nThe ground is shifting beneath global health. Time will tell whether this moment will lead to institutional reforms, but as individuals we don’t need to wait to reform how we approach collaborations. I suspect student readers wouldn’t have it any other way."

    "title": "2  Build Collaborations",
    "section": "2.2 Team Science",
    "text": "2.2 Team Science\nMost modern science, and global health research in particular, is a never-ending series of group projects. This might be a chilling prospect if you haven’t had good experiences with group work, but I’m here to tell you that team science can be very rewarding and productive given the right environment. As it’s very likely that you’ll join many teams in your global health career, we should discuss what makes a team effective and how to prepare yourself to be a good teammate.\nThe National Cancer Institute of the NIH (U.S.) defines team science as:\n\na collaborative effort to address a scientific challenge that leverages the strengths and expertise of professionals, oftentimes trained in different fields\n\nTeams span the continuum from small investigator-led ‘labs’ to large, highly integrated groups of professionals sharing leadership responsibilities (Bennett et al., 2018). Increasingly, given the complexity of today’s research problems and a trend toward specialization in research expertise and methods, teams bring together people from different disciplines and locations. While the payoff of creating more diverse and skilled teams can be substantial, so are the challenges.\n\nBennett, L. M. et al. (2018). Collaboration team science: Field guide. US Department of Health & Human Services, National Institutes of Health.\nRecognizing the growing importance of team science, researchers established a new field of inquiry in 2006 called the Science-of-Team-Science to study what makes scientific teams click. Many of the findings have made their way into Collaboration and Team Science: A Field Guide, a handbook published by the NIH in 2010 and updated in 2018. In the following sections, I’ll walk you through each of the Field Guide’s top ten takeaways for getting the most out of team science.\n\nVISION\n\nA strong and captivating vision attracts people to the team and provides a foundation for achieving team goals. Shared vision provides a focal point around which a highly functioning team can coalesce.\n\nSome science collaborations are like the 2001 American heist comedy film, Ocean’s Eleven. In the movie, Danny Ocean, played by George Clooney, is released from prison and immediately begins recruiting a hand-selected, nine-member crew to rob three of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas. One-by-one, Ocean pitches them on the idea and secures their cooperation. Ocean’s vision was simple: steal $150 million in cash without getting caught. Once the team was in place, they worked together to hatch a plan.\nOthers collaborations are more like the 1995 film, Apollo 13, about America’s third crewed mission to the moon. Fifty-five minutes into the mission, when the spacecraft was about 330,000 km from Earth, there was an explosion in the service module that caused oxygen to leak into space. The lunar landing was aborted, and the three-man crew moved into the lunar module for a dramatic rescue attempt. The team on the ground at mission control and the astronauts in space had to work together to find a way return the spacecraft to Earth before the astronauts ran out of water and oxygen.\nIn both movies, the teams had a clearly defined and shared vision. As well, team members understood their roles and how they were to contribute to the vision. Research on teams suggests that these factors are key to creating group cohesion. When team members can’t articulate the vision or don’t understand how their contributions fit into the bigger picture, the team’s work often suffers.\nThe stories portrayed in these films differed in an important way with respect to teams, however: how the vision was created. In Ocean’s Eleven, the vision belonged to Danny Ocean and he made a compelling case to prospective team members. But in Apollo 13, the team co-created the vision in the context of an ongoing collaboration.\n\n\nWe’ll talk more about how to write a compelling Specific Aims document later in the book. It’s a great format for articulating a vision.\nIn this respect, the Ocean’s Eleven model is more prevalent in global health research. A lead scientist—the principal investigator—finds a funding opportunity, writes a short concept note, often called a Specific Aims document, and invites collaborators to join the proposal. There is nothing inherently wrong with this model, but the opening of this chapter should lead us to reflect on this privilege. Namely, whose vision becomes reality in global health is driven by whose vision is funded. Funding decisions tend to favor scholars from the Global North, so visions of the Global South are underrepresented in global health research. One way we can promote change is to build lasting collaborations. When collaborators continue to work together over time, visions can come from anyone on the mission.\n\n\nTEAM EVOLUTION AND DYNAMICS\n\nResearch teams form and develop through critical stages to achieve their highest potential (Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing). A positive team dynamic sustains and further strengthens a research team, enabling it to achieve successful outcomes.\n\nThe most famous framework for understanding how teams evolve is Tuckman’s 1965 Model of Group Development, as described in Field Guide:\n\nForming—The team is established using either a top-down (Ocean’s Eleven) or bottom-up (Apollo 13) approach.\nStorming—Team members establish roles and responsibilities. This process may trigger disagreements or “turf battles” and reveal a reluctance to appreciate the perspectives and contributions of people from different disciplines or training. However, if collegial disagreement is supported and premature pressure to consensus is resisted, people will begin to open up to one another.\nNorming—Team members begin to work together effectively and efficiently, start to develop trust and comfort with one another, and learn they can rely on each other.\nPerforming—The team works together seamlessly, focuses on a shared goal, and efficiently resolves issues or problems that emerge.\nAdjourning or Transforming—Once the team accomplishes its goal, it can celebrate the accomplishment and disband or take on a new problem.\n\nA proven way to strengthen team dynamics is to maintain a collegial environment where members are recognized for their contributions and given opportunities to grow.\n\n\nTRUST\n\nIt is almost impossible to imagine a successful collaboration without trust. Trust provides the foundation for a team. Without trust it is nearly impossible to sustain a collaboration.\n\nNew teams can establish trust by establishing rules and norms. It’s common for teams to co-create a written charter or collaboration agreement that details how their members will work together, resolve disputes, share the workload, and share the credit. This practice is particularly important when teams bring together people from different backgrounds, disciplinary and otherwise, where the existing norms can differ.\n\n\nThis is calculus-based trust. You trust that other people will follow the rules because not doing so has consequences. Another form of trust is competency-based trust: when your reputation or expertise precedes you and folks know that you can be trusted to perform.\nWith time and experience, teams can build deeper forms of identity-based trust based on personal connections and a recognition of shared values. This type of trust is often earned through actions and should not be assumed. Creating and maintaining trust takes substantial effort.\n\n\nCOMMUNICATION\n\nEffective communication within and outside a research team contributes to effective group functioning. It depends on a safe environment where team members can openly share and discuss new scientific ideas and take research into new, previously unconsidered directions as well as ensure that difficult conversations can take place.\n\nTrust and communication are reciprocal. Teams that trust each other communicate openly, and open communication builds trust. However, effective communication can be challenging for new inter-disciplinary teams where members may not share a vocabulary for the science. A recurring theme in this chapter is that successful teams make space for and devote time to establishing common frameworks, including a shared vocabulary.\nThis extends to creating expectations around communication and participation. How often will you meet as a team? What will the format be, and how will you give opportunities for members to be heard? What type of communication is suitable for email vs business messaging apps? When should an email or message thread become a quick phone call or meet-up?\n\n\nCONFLICT AND DISAGREEMENT\n\nConflict can be both a resource and a challenge—a resource because disagreement can expand thinking, add new knowledge to a complex scientific problem, and stimulate new directions for research. A challenge because if it is not handled skillfully, conflict impedes effective team functioning and stifles scientific advancement.\n\nWhenever teams are communicating, conflict and disagreement are possible. In fact, effective teams often encourage the type of critical reflection and constructive criticism that can make conflict and disagreement more likely. This is because they know that conflict is a normal part of collaboration and that, when properly managed, conflict can lead to progress and cohesion. Of course, it’s also true that scientific conflict and disagreement can lead to interpersonal conflict and tension that impairs the team’s ability to achieve its vision.\nTeam leaders play a large role in keeping debate and disagreement productive and in mediating conflicts, but each of us is responsible for our own contributions to the collective dynamic. The Field Guide recommends that we consider the following steps for managing and resolving conflict:\n\nUnderstand the culture and the context of conflict—seek out the meaning of the conflict for yourself and/or the other parties.\nActively listen—assure others you have heard what they said and ask questions to confirm your understanding.\nAcknowledge emotions—they will likely be part of the conflict, but expressing them and hearing them can help lift barriers to resolution.\nLook beneath the surface for hidden meaning—hidden fears, needs, histories, or goals may be the underlying source of the problem.\nSeparate what matters from what is in the way—get away from discussing who is right or wrong and focus more on how to satisfy mutual needs.\nLearn from difficult behaviors—let those experiences help you develop your skills in managing difficult situations and having empathy for and patience with others.\nSolve problems creatively and negotiate collaboratively—this also means committing to action.\nUnderstand why others might be resistant to change—the problem could be an unmet need.\n\n\n\nSELF-AWARENESS AND EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nEmotional Intelligence among team members contributes to the effective functioning of research teams. Self awareness gives people greater control over their own emotional reactions to others, improves the quality of their interactions, and helps build other-awareness.\n\nResearch and science textbooks do not typically emphasize the importance of self-reflection, but the ability to reflect and become self-aware is a core skill required of today’s team science. Someone who lacks self-awareness has limited options for responding to challenging colleagues. People who can take someone else’s perspective and embrace what makes them different have a superpower in team science.\nReflection is also key in collaborations that bring together people from different backgrounds. Whether your work takes you to a new neighborhood or halfway around the world, it’s critical to have the humility to listen and learn.\n\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nStrong collaborative leadership elicits and capitalizes on the team members’ strengths and is a critical component of team success. Leadership can be demonstrated by every team member, not just the formal leader(s).\n\nI’ve worked with many effective leaders throughout my career. Although they took different approaches to leadership, each person possessed an ability to encourage and motivate individual team members, articulate and maintain a shared vision, and have difficult conversations. The ineffective leaders I’ve encountered were variously disengaged, timid, defensive, or hostile.\nEvery scientific collaboration you join as a trainee is an opportunity to observe and practice leadership. Take notes on what you appreciate in your leaders, and reflect on how poor leadership stifles progress. Spend time developing self-awareness and other-awareness, and approach difficult conversations with openness.\n\n\nMENTORING\n\nMentoring is an indispensable aspect of successful collaboration. A mentor recognizes the strengths of each team member, identifies areas in which newer scientists have the greatest potential to grow, and can help coach people to attain their aspirations. With good mentoring, the development of scientists is synchronous with strengthening team dynamics.\n\nOne of the best investments you can make as a trainee is in finding a good mentor. The return should go far beyond leaving with a good letter of recommendation. A good mentor-mentee relationship can set a strong foundation for a scientific career. If you look at the curriculum vitae—or scholarly record—of successful scientists, you’ll likely see the fingerprints of one or more helpful mentors. Mentors can expose you to new collaborations and resources, help to nurture your ideas, steer you around traps, and teach you the ‘hidden curriculum’ of your scientific discipline that you won’t learn in the classroom.\nFinding a mentor can be a daunting task, especially if you are introverted. Even when you get up the courage to reach out to a potential mentor, your email might go unreturned or come back without an offer to meet. Keep trying, but consider this advice:\n\nAttend scientific talks and department events when possible and introduce yourself\nReach out to the mentor’s other students to learn more about potential opportunities\nKeep your correspondence short with a clear request\nDo you homework—general requests to learn about a person’s work are less effective than a specific statement of how your interests align\n\n\n\nRECOGNITION AND SHARING SUCCESS\n\nIndividual contributions should be recognized, reviewed, and rewarded in the context of a collaboration. Recognition and reward of all team members should be done thoughtfully and fairly in the context of the team and the institution.\n\nMost years on December 10, going back to 1901, the King of Sweden awards several prizes in fields such as medicine, chemistry, and physics, in honor of Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. Each prize can be given to a single laureate or shared by no more than three laureates.\nIn 2015, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was divided between three scientists in recognition of two discoveries that shaped treatments in global health. William Campbell and Satoshi Ōmura shared half of the prize “for their discoveries concerning a novel therapy against infections caused by roundworm parasites”, and Tu Youyou received the other half “for her discoveries concerning a novel therapy against Malaria”.\nThe importance of these discoveries cannot be overstated. Ivermectin (Ōmura and Campbell) and artemisinin (Tu) have helped hundreds of millions of people. These accomplishments deserved to be recognized, and these scientists played significant roles. Tu Youyou even volunteered to be the first human to test her team’s new drug!\nThat said, these individual awards don’t recognize the teams behind this work. Campbell noted as much in his Nobel Lecture, taking a moment to graciously acknowledge his collaborators (Campbell, n.d.):\n\nCampbell, W. C. (n.d.). Nobel lecture.\n\nThere is a question that warrants a slight digression here. In the past few weeks I have often been asked how I felt when I heard that I had won the Nobel Prize. I can say without hesitation that my mind was instantly flooded with two emotions. One was a sense of joy and gratitude. The other was a feeling of sadness—sadness that so many of the people who made this discovery a success could not be named individually. But I represent the research team at Merck & Co., Inc., and in that role I feel honored and grateful beyond imagining.\n\nDespite the growing prevalence of team science, professional recognition and career advancement still depend in large part on individual achievement. This is one reason that it is critical for teams to plan ahead to share recognition and credit.\n\n\nDepending on your line of research, credit might also come in the form of patents.\n\nICMJE. (n.d.). Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly work in Medical Journals.\nOne of the clearest records of achievement in science is academic publication. Decisions about who receives recognition as an author of a scientific paper can help to make or break careers. On some research teams, the leader decides who deserves to be an author with little to no input from more junior members. This has the potential to lead to resentment and create competition rather than collaboration. Team science advocates encourage a different approach: creating a transparent plan as soon as possible to identify how members will contribute, be recognized, and share the credit. Sometimes this credit will come in the form of authorship. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, or ICMJE, recommends four criteria that should determine who should be offered the opportunity (ICMJE, n.d.):\n\n\nA person who meets some but not all of the criteria should be acknowledged in the paper for their contributions.\n\nMakes substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND\nDrafts the work or revises it critically for important intellectual content; AND\nGives final approval of the version to be published; AND\nAgrees to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.\n\n\n\nIn recent years it has become more common for authors to include a footnote on the title page of an article indicating that two or more authors should be considered to be co-first authors in recognition of equal contributions.\nIt’s often not enough to decide who gets to be an author. Many teams also have to think through order of authorship. In some fields, including public health and medicine, author order is interpreted to be a reflection of the magnitude of each person’s contributions. For instance, the first author is the lead author and receives the most credit in the eyes of some hiring and promotion committees—“look, they are establishing their ‘independence’”. The principal investigator might take this position or choose instead to go last in the order, taking what is known as the senior author slot. Everyone in between is a middle author. On some teams, the closer to the front you fall, the more work might be expected of you.\n\n\nLarge teams spanning multiple organizations sometimes form study groups and publish under the name of the group. For instance, I’ve published several papers with the Depression Screening Data PHQ Collaboration, or DEPRESSD.\nThink this is too complicated? Then become an economist! Economists often default to alphabetical order. (But if your name is Zarby you might as well stick to medicine.)\n\n\nNAVIGATING AND LEVERAGING NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS\n\nHighly collaborative teams can transcend different organizational structures, extending their reach across and beyond the organization. They often function within the context of multiple and sometimes interconnected systems, and they can help establish strong networks of researchers who together can accomplish more than they could as individuals.\n\nEvery new job requires you to learn the lay of the land, and jobs in global health and academia are no exception. But as team science and interdisciplinary research become more common, this task gets increasingly difficult. It’s part of your team leader’s responsibility to help you understand and navigate the system in which your team operates, but I want to leave you with a few common networks that you’ll find in global health:\nAcademic Institutions: University > School > Department > Center\nInstitutes: Often sit outside of schools and drawing faculty from across the University. Can have one or more centers.\nWorking/Study Groups: A formal or informal group of investigators from one or more institutions that share a common interest or purpose.\nConsortiums: A collection of organizations that are partnering on a specific project or initiative. Consortiums are often led by one organization (the prime) that makes subawards or subcontracts to several partner organizations (subs).\nCommissions/Expert Panels: A temporary group established by a body such as a journal that brings together experts to study an issue and create a report or recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBONUS PRINCIPLE: Fairness\n\n\n\nA challenge for many collaborators is a lack of time and attention. This is particularly true for senior collaborators who might be juggling several projects, as well as for collaborators of all ranks who are not adequately funded by the project. This routinely happens in global health projects where researchers and practitioners from under-resourced settings are asked to join a team but are not compensated and do not have protected research time from their institutions. It’s common in these situations to spend a portion of every meeting reminding team members of the project goals—the vision.\nWhen your team has busy, but well-funded senior colleagues, creating a vision statement and always orienting the team to this North Star can be a helpful strategy. But even the best crafted documents are no substitute for offering funded time when you are asking resource-constrained colleagues to lend their time and attention to your vision."

CBPR requires researchers to share power and credit with people who are most often ‘subjects’, not partners.\n\nIsrael, B. A. et al. (1998).

A US-based team with links to a local non-profit organization in rural Kenya recruited 20 community members—church leaders, healthcare staff, teachers, village chiefs—to join a community advisory committee. This academic-community partnership collaborated on all aspects of the research, starting with workshops designed to share expertise and establish a common vision. The team then planned an assessment of community needs and resources and jointly analyzed and interpreted the data. This was followed by a series of intervention development workshops to create a model of HIV prevention that was informed by science and local priorities. The partnership continued through the design and implementation of a randomized controlled pilot trial to test the intervention."
