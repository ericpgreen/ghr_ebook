<p>I’ve had this conversation hundreds of times since that court appearance.

</div></div><p>Go any deeper below the ontological surface, however, and you’ll find that there is not a consensus definition of global health <span class="citation" data-cites="merson:2018">(<a href="references.html#ref-merson:2018" role="doc-biblioref">Merson et al., 2018</a>)</span>. We’ll adopt this one from <span class="citation" data-cites="koplan:2009">Koplan et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-koplan:2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Global health is an area for study, research, and practice that places a priority on improving health and achieving equity in health for all people worldwide.</strong> Global health emphasizes transnational health issues, determinants, and solutions; involves many disciplines within and beyond the health sciences and promotes interdisciplinary collaboration; and is a synthesis of population-based prevention with individual-level clinical care.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take note of two key elements of their definition:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>it includes scholars, researchers, and practitioners working across disciplinary boundaries; and</li>
<li>it goes beyond simply improving health to include the goal of achieving health equity.</li>
</ol>
<p>To expand on the first point, this definition reflects the reality that global health challenges are complex, so the search for solutions must span disciplines. In the study of malaria, for example, you can read about the spread of the disease (epidemiology), the impact of illness on future productivity (economics), the merits of free or subsidized bed nets (public policy), mosquito habitats (ecology), the efficacy of vaccines to prevent the disease (medicine and statistics), rapid diagnostic tests (biomedical engineering), and the adoption and use of bed nets (psychology), just to name a few areas of inquiry.</p>
<p>The second point is that global health is action-oriented, seeking to achieve health equity for all people worldwide. The WHO <span class="citation" data-cites="who:2021">(<a href="references.html#ref-who:2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> defines <strong>equity</strong> as follows:</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="ref-who:2021" class="csl-entry" role="doc-biblioentry">
WHO. (2021). <em><a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-equity">Health <span>Equity</span></a></em>.
</div></div><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Equity is the absence of unfair, avoidable or remediable differences among groups of people, whether those groups are defined socially, economically, demographically, or geographically or by other dimensions of inequality (e.g.&nbsp;sex, gender, ethnicity, disability, or sexual orientation). Health is a fundamental human right. Health equity is achieved when everyone can attain their full potential for health and well-being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put another way, health inequities are unfair and unjust differences in healthcare access or health outcomes that can be prevented or fixed. Health inequities are structural, often resulting from decisions we make about who gets access to resources.</p>
<p>The consequence of inequity is often inequality. For instance, inequitable access to healthcare services can lead to unequal health outcomes—<strong>health inequalities</strong>—between groups. Differences in health status are also referred to as <strong>health disparities</strong>.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has given us many examples of health inequities and disparities. For instance, data compiled by the website <em>Health Inequities Tracker</em>, visualized in <a href="#fig-disparity">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.1</span></a>, show that through at least August 2021, Hispanics and Latinos in the United States were over-represented in COVID-19 hospitalizations, while non-Hispanic Whites were substantially under-represented <span class="citation" data-cites="het">(<a href="references.html#ref-het" role="doc-biblioref">Satcher Health Leadership Institute, 2021</a>)</span>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Consider the directed acyclic graph, or DAG, in <a href="#fig-coviddag">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.2</span></a> that illustrates how social determinants of health might have influenced the pandemic. I’ll introduce DAGs in more detail in a later chapter, so for now think of this as a (simplified) hypothesized conceptual model of what precipitates COVID-19 infection and hospitalization.</p>

</div>
<p>As represented in this DAG, hospitalization with COVID-19 is <em>directly</em> caused by infection with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, but who gets infected is not completely random. Infectious diseases are social affairs, and some people are more vulnerable because of their context. For instance, vaccinated individuals are less likely to get infected, and vaccination rates are highest in the U.S. among the most educated. Looking further back in the causal chain, educational attainment is highest among groups without historical social inequities such as systematic racism.</p>
<p>A diagram like this suggests that to prevent future pandemics we need to gain a deeper understanding of the interaction between social determinants of health and disease risk. More importantly, it implies that we have work to do to fix the underlying societal inequities that make certain groups more vulnerable. As we’ve seen with COVID-19, technological solutions alone—like developing a vaccine in record time—may not be sufficient.</p>

</div></div><p>Another example of a COVID-19 inequity is global access to vaccines (see <a href="#fig-coviddag">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.2</span></a>). By October 2021, nearly half of the world’s population had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but the first 6.5 billion doses mostly went into the arms of citizens of wealthy countries. Less than 3 percent of people in low-income countries had received even one dose. While true that many low-income countries escaped the worst of the pandemic’s first few waves, the glacial roll out of vaccines globally—what some have decried as a vaccine apartheid—leaves many nations vulnerable to deadly new variants. This puts everyone at risk. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Helen Clark, the former heads of Liberia and New Zealand, respectively, state this plainly in the inaugural issue of PLOS Global Public Health <span class="citation" data-cites="sirleaf:2021">(<a href="references.html#ref-sirleaf:2021" role="doc-biblioref">Sirleaf et al., 2021</a>)</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Achieving vaccination justice is the first great test of this pandemic era—it requires targets and aspirations for vaccine access to be determined by health criteria not a country’s economic status, and timely delivery not a two-speed world where high-income populations are fully immunized within months but the poor are denied access for years. Meeting the vaccine justice test will signal that we have both understood the interdependence that determines our planetary future and have the capacity to act on it. Failing the test will condemn us to a ‘forever crisis’ of insecurity and recrimination as virus variants are given free rein and new vaccines struggle to keep up.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-research"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> What is Research?</h2>
<div class="page-columns page-full">

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>This definition comes from Title 45 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46, Subpart A, also known as the <a href="http://ghr.link/shy">Common Rule</a>.</p>
</div></div></div>
<p><strong>Research</strong> is a systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. Let’s break down this definition.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Research is systematic in that it follows a documented and repeatable methodology.</li>
<li>Investigations include research development, testing, and evaluation.</li>
<li>By generalizable knowledge, we mean that the investigation intends to advance our scientific understanding. The goal is to go beyond the collection of facts about a particular sample and make conclusions that have relevance for other scholars, practitioners, or policymakers.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, you might interview parents of young children about their use of mosquito nets. You intend to analyze the transcripts and develop new ideas about the barriers to bed net use that you hope to publish in an academic journal. Other scholars will read this work use it to develop new theories of health behavior and create new interventions that promote bed net use. This is research.</p>
<p>But what if a journalist wants to write a feature article about the burden of malaria and interviews a few of the <em>same</em> parents? Is this research?</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>The Common Rule definition of research excludes journalism activities, public health surveillance activities in support of an order from a public health agency, criminal justice investigations, and operational activities related to national security.</p>
</div></div><p>No.</p>
<p>For one, the journalist might not follow a systematic method for deciding which parents to approach, how to conduct the interviews, or how to synthesize what they learn. Second, the journalist has a different objective. Whereas you wanted to systematically advance our understanding of barriers to bed net use—insights that might apply to different parents in other settings—the journalist intends to inform the public by telling the stories of a few specific parents.</p>
<p>Another way that a study can advance scientific understanding is by developing and testing scientific methods and procedures. For instance, a research team might plan a small pilot test to collect initial data that will inform the design of a larger study. In most cases, we’d consider these pre-study activities to be research—even if the team does not intend to publish the results—because the pilot study is part of the knowledge generation process.</p>
<p>But here again, intent matters. Let’s say Facebook (Meta) randomly assigns a small percentage of its users to receive email campaign A or campaign B and tracks which campaign generates the most clicks or sales. The company’s objective in this case is to determine which campaign optimizes their marketing spend for conversions, not to say something more general about human perception and behavior. Therefore, it’s not considered research.</p>
<p>As we’ll discuss in a later chapter, it’s always a good idea to consult with an Institutional Review Board to determine if your proposed work is considered research (and if it is, whether it falls under policies requiring ethical review).</p>

<p>People often ask me questions that, at least in theory, can be answered with data, but I don’t know the answers. In these situations, I like to remove my glasses, stare into middle distance, and say, “That’s an interesting empirical question”. It means, “I don’t know. We should collect some data.”</p>
</div></div><p>Science is built on systematic data collection. That’s what makes it an empirical endeavor. Expert opinion is a form of evidence, but it’s not <strong>empirical</strong> evidence. Empirical evidence comes from systematic observation, and the method of observation can be quantitative or qualitative.

<p>Scientific research uses public methods that can be examined and replicated. A Method section in a scientific paper is like a recipe. If you’ve ever tried to follow a confusing recipe, you can appreciate the importance of good documentation. Your study’s recipe must be clear (well written), thorough (no ‘dash’ of this or that), and shared publicly (not a secret passed down to lab members).</p>
<p>We care about complete and transparent reporting in science for several reasons. First, as consumers of research, we rely on authors’ descriptions of their empirical methods to come to our own conclusions about the findings. If research colleagues cannot inspect your methods, they will have little reason to trust your results. Second, no one study should ever rule the day. If the results of your study are robust, another research group should be able to follow the recipe and replicate the findings. When such findings are replicated, we all have more confidence in the results. Third, sharing your methods makes scientific progress possible.</p>

<section id="the-goal-is-inference" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="the-goal-is-inference">THE GOAL IS INFERENCE</h3>
<p>Empiricism is essential to science, but science is more than observation. To create generalizable knowledge, you need data <em>and</em> inference. There are two broad categories of <strong>inference</strong>: (a) descriptive inference and (b) causal inference.</p>
<p><strong>Descriptive inference</strong> is using the data we observe to make conclusions about that which we don’t or can’t observe directly. For instance, you might survey 200 people about their health beliefs, but your real aim is to make conclusions about the broader group. You use the data you have from 200 people to make this inference.</p>
<p><strong>Causal inference</strong> involves a different mental leap where we ask “what if” to make conclusions about causes and effects. Consider the case where we want to know which pill works better to resolve an illness, the red one or the blue one. The fundamental challenge to getting an answer is that we can’t give someone both pills <em>simultaneously</em>. An individual can only take one pill at a time. In this situation we might be able to randomly assign people to each type of pill as a tool for making a causal inference. But frequently, random assignment isn’t possible and we have to use other strategies for asking “what if”.</p>

<p>Every method has limitations, every measurement has error, and every model is wrong to some extent. Take the estimation of maternal mortality rates as an example. Hogan published estimates for 181 countries <span class="citation" data-cites="hogan:2010">(<a href="references.html#ref-hogan:2010" role="doc-biblioref">Hogan et al., 2010</a>)</span>. Some countries, such as the United States, have vast amounts of data in vital registries that attempt to track all births and deaths. It’s not perfect, so we still estimate the maternal mortality rate using a statistical model.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="ref-hogan:2010" class="csl-entry" role="doc-biblioentry">
Hogan, M. C. et al. (2010). <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)60518-1/abstract">Maternal mortality for 181 countries, 1980–2008: A systematic analysis of progress towards millennium development goal 5</a>. <em>The Lancet</em>, <em>375</em>(9726), 1609–1623.

<p>This is still several hundred mostly preventable deaths per year. Currently in the U.S., the rate of maternal mortality among non-hispanic Black women is at least <a href="http://ghr.link/hip">2.5 times higher</a> than the rate for non-hispanic White women.</p>
</div></div></div>
<p>As you can see in the left panel of <a href="#fig-mmr">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.4</span></a>, the United States has a (relatively) low level of maternal mortality, between about 10-20 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live child births. Compared to some countries, the US has a lot of data points for estimating the level and trend in maternal deaths, so the uncertainty band is narrow.</p>

<p>Now take a look at Afghanistan on the right. Note that the y-axis scale is much larger in the 1000s, reflecting the fact that many more Afghan women die of causes related to pregnancy or childbirth. Next, pay attention to the width of the uncertainty band. It spans a range of more than 3000 deaths. Compare this to a range of fewer than 5 deaths in the US! This is because there are very few data points available to estimate the ‘true’ value in Afghanistan, and these individual data points can differ by more than 1000 deaths.</p>
<p>The takeaway message is that there is uncertainty in everything. No single estimate can be considered <em>the</em> answer. Embrace uncertainty and you will become a better scientist.</p>

<p>Research is divided into two main categories: basic and applied. Overlapping with applied research is an area of work called “monitoring and evaluation”, or M&amp;E. Let’s examine what constitutes research before turning to M&amp;E.</p>
<section id="basic-research" class="level3 unnumbered page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="basic-research">BASIC RESEARCH</h3>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>Basic research is sometimes referred to as the ‘bench’ in the ‘bench to bedside’ cascade of research needed to take an idea from the lab to a new medical treatment. This is accurate but incomplete. Fields like psychology also conduct basic research into constructs like emotion and violence that seek to expand our understanding. This is not ‘bench science’ as typically imagined, but it’s basic research nonetheless.</p>
</div></div><p><strong>Basic research</strong>—also known as “pure” or “blue skies” research—is the pursuit of fundamental knowledge of phenomena. For example, scientists conduct laboratory experiments to understand the parasitic life cycle and how parasites interact with humans at different stages. Another example is the scientific investigation of the properties of cancer cells to better understand how they grow and spread.</p>
<p>The information generated by basic science becomes the basis for applied science. Harvard neurobiologist Dr.&nbsp;Rachel Wilson explains this beautifully:</p>

<p>These phases are broadly similar across different regulatory bodies around the world, including the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization in India, and the National Medical Products Administration in China, among many others.

<p>One type of clinical research is a clinical trial. <a href="#tbl-phases">Table&nbsp;<span>1.2</span></a> lists the phases of trials that drugs, biologics, devices, and instruments complete prior to going to market. In the early phases of drug trials, the objective is to understand how the compound affects the body. What is a safe dose that could be effective? Phase 3 trials put the optimal dose to the test, seeking to determine if the drug “works” and to quantify the size of the effect. Drugs that pass this test are typically approved for use by the governing regulatory body. Once a drug reaches market, Phase 4 trials monitor side effects and efficacy over time.</p>

<strong>CASE STUDY: Developing the first malaria vaccine</strong>
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>In 2021, after more than 35 years of research, the World Health Organization recommended widespread use of a vaccine candidate called RTS,S/AS01, or Mosquirix™, to prevent <em>P. falciparum</em> malaria in children.</p>
<p>Development of RTS,S/AS01 began in 1984, and soon after, a promising vaccine candidate entered preclinical research. Researchers performed tests on nonhuman subjects to collect data on how well the vaccine worked (efficacy), how much damage it could do to an organism (toxicity), and how the body affected the vaccine (pharmacokinetics).</p>
<p>Clinical research on humans began in 1992. Researchers conducted a Phase 1 safety and immunogenicity trial with 20 adults in The Gambia in 1997. Results suggested that the vaccine did not have any significant toxicity but did produce the expected antibodies.</p>
<p>Several Phase 2 studies conducted over the next decade demonstrated the efficacy of the vaccine against several endpoints. A Phase 2b trial began in Mozambique in 2003 with more than 2,000 children. Each child was randomly assigned to receive 3 doses of RTS,S or a control vaccine. After 6 months, the prevalence of malaria was 37% lower in the treatment group than in the control group. This Phase 2 trial was an important proof-of-concept study.</p>
<p>The results of a large Phase 3 trial with more than 15,000 infants and young children in 7 African countries were published in 2015. Children who participated in the study were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 arms: (i) 3 doses of RTS,S and a booster dose at month 20, (ii) 3 doses of RTS,S and a booster dose of a comparator vaccine at month 20, or (iii) 4 doses of a comparator vaccine. RTS,S reduced clinical malaria cases by 28% and 18% among young children and infants, respectively, over a 3 to 4-year period. This Phase 3 trial demonstrated that the treatment was efficacious.</p>
<p>On the basis of these results, the European Medicines Agency issued a favorable “European scientific opinion”. This led the health ministries in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi to authorize a pilot study in 2019 to assess the feasibility of administering the required four doses of the vaccine as part of routine childhood immunization programs. After more than 800,000 children were immunized under this program, the WHO recommended that countries with moderate to high transmission adopt the vaccine.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation research</strong> is the study of strategies for expanding the reach and coverage of tested ideas to improve population health. A common scenario is where intervention research demonstrates that a treatment is efficacious, such as ORT, but take-up is low and slow, thus limiting its impact. The implementation research question is how to best promote its use.</p>

In essence, program evaluations should be as rigorous as logistics, ethics, politics, and resources permit—and no less.

<p>A clinical trialist who conducts RCTs for a living is unlikely to refer to a clinical trial as an ‘impact evaluation’, even though an RCT is a type of impact evaluation. This language is more commonly used by economists and others who study the impact of social sector programs and interventions. This video from the World Bank introduces impact evaluations.</p>
</div></div></div>
<p>Evaluations can take different forms and serve various purposes. A subset of both applied research and program evaluation is the impact evaluation. An <strong>impact evaluation</strong> is a study that aims to quantify the causal effect—or impact—of a program or policy on some outcome of interest. There are several research designs that can generate evidence of impact. One example is the randomized controlled trial, or RCT, a mainstay of Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. Not all impact evaluations use random assignment to make causal inferences, but they all share the goal of making a cause-and-effect claim. As we’ll see in later chapters, the strength of this claim rests on the assumptions of the particular research design.</p>

<section id="monitoring" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="monitoring">Monitoring</h4>
<p><strong>Program monitoring</strong> is concerned with documenting the implementation of programs and interventions. How are resources being used? How many people participate? Does the program reach the intended targets? Not all programs are evaluated (“do they work?”), but most are monitored (“what happened?”) to some degree for accountability to funders. Researchers can use monitoring data to document participants’ exposure to the program and to conduct economic analyses related to program costs and impacts.</p>
<p>A related activity is the process evaluation. A <strong>process evaluation</strong> goes beyond monitoring counts and tallies, largely an administrative task, to ask if a program is being delivered as intended. This gets at the question of fidelity of the implementation to the original design. Process evaluations are essential for impact evaluations: If a program fails to show an impact, the next question is why? Did the program fail because the idea or theory behind the program was wrong (<strong>theory failure</strong>)? Or was the implementation of the program so troubled that there was never a chance for success (<strong>implementation failure</strong>)?</p>

<p>Development assistance for health includes funded research, but it’s not inclusive of all research in low- and middle-income countries (e.g., does not include domestic spending on research). Nor does it capture research on global health issues in wealthy nations. Inequities in health exist everywhere, so by definition global health research is a broad domain. It’s difficult to put a dollar amount on the enterprise as a whole.
