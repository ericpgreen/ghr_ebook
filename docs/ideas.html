<p>Actual footage of my first research meeting in grad school, <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/muppets-p9bj7nrUPAypq">via GIPHY</a>.</p>
</div></div></div>
<p>In my experience as a mentor and former student, one of the most anxiety-producing moments in student life is when a new mentor says, “tell me about your ideas”. Why is this innocent prompt so terrifying? It might be because we have the wrong understanding of the origin of good ideas.</p>
<p>In his book <em>Where Do Good Ideas Come From?</em>, Steven Johnson argues that good ideas are usually not eureka moments as we tend to imagine. Instead, good ideas are often the product of fertile environments where ideas are allowed to “connect, fuse, and recombine” over time.</p>
<p>Two of Johnson’s insights are particularly relevant for us: the notion of the <em>slow hunch</em> and the <em>adjacent possible</em>. These concepts help to explain why generating research ideas can be so hard, especially for students.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full">

<p>Watch Steven Johnson talk about <a href="http://ghr.link/ide"><em>Where Good Ideas Come From</em></a>.</p>
</div></div></div>
<p>First, the student timeline is often hostile to innovation. Learning and assignments are compressed into semesters, but many ideas need more time to take shape. As Johnson writes:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Most great ideas first take shape in a partial, incomplete form.</strong> They have the seeds of something profound, but they lack a key element that can turn the hunch into something truly powerful…They start with a vague, hard-to-describe sense that there’s an interesting solution to a problem that hasn’t yet been proposed, and they linger in the shadows of the mind, sometimes for decades, assembling new connections and gaining strength.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ideas take time to develop. This is the <strong>slow hunch</strong> concept. “But I have a research meeting with my mentor next Tuesday and she wants a list of ideas!!”, you say. Breathe, don’t panic. When you recognize that good ideas come from the accumulation of slow hunches, you will learn to enjoy the process. Your first idea will be the start of your journey, not the end. Your best ideas might not conform to this semester’s schedule, and that is OK.</p>
<p>The second insight is that we’re always sitting on the edge of a breakthrough, but we need access to certain raw materials to unlock this discovery. This is the <strong>adjacent possible</strong> concept, which Johnson describes as follows:</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full">

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">

<p>Searching for the adjacent possible the night before your paper is due, <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/cheezburger-cartoons-doors-Tb2i75AlI926I">via GIPHY</a>.</p>
</div></div></div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Think of [the adjacent possible] as a house that magically expands with each door you open. You begin in a room with four doors, each leading to a new room that you haven’t visited yet. Those four rooms are the adjacent possible. But once you open one of those doors and stroll into that room, three new doors appear, each leading to a brand-new room that you couldn’t have reached from your original starting point. Keep opening new doors and eventually you’ll have built a palace.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>Johnson borrows the metaphor of the adjacent possible from theoretical biologist Stuart Kauffman to illustrate the importance of connecting ideas.</p>
</div></div><p>The first room is a metaphor for your initial understanding of a new topic. It’s pretty empty because you are new, but your room has many potential doors to open—many lines of research to explore. When you open one door by searching the literature—and by connecting with other colleagues at talks, conferences, meet-ups—more doors appear. Figuring out which doors to walk through (and which ones to close) is a skill that comes with practice. Many literature searches can lead to apparent dead ends, but with each door you open, new hunches form. And when you have opened enough doors:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>…one day [your hunches] are transformed into something more substantial: sometimes jolted out by some newly discovered trove of information, or by another hunch lingering in another mind, or by an internal association that finally completes the thought.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="find-a-research-problem"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Find a Research Problem</h2>
<p>Every study begins with a motivating <strong>research problem</strong>. A research problem is your study’s <em>ikigai</em>, its “reason for being”, to borrow a Japanese concept. A research problem should convey a clear reason for being, a clear sense of purpose. Typically, a research problem gets framed as the gap in our knowledge—a gap in the literature.</p>
<p>A defining characteristic of all research problems is that they are potentially solvable <span class="citation" data-cites="leary:2012">(<a href="references.html#ref-leary:2012" role="doc-biblioref">Leary, 2012</a>)</span>. To qualify as a <em>research</em> problem, we must be able to use systematic, public methods to gather and analyze data on the problem. For instance, research has shown that insecticide treated bed nets can prevent malaria infections in kids, but in many places kids are not sleeping underneath bed nets every night. Therefore, a research problem to solve might be that we don’t know how to encourage families to adopt and use this effective method of prevention.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"></div><p>Finding research problems worth studying becomes easier with experience. Once you’ve studied a field for a few years, you’ll have cultivated a list of journals, conferences, funders, and colleagues whom you follow to keep up with the latest developments and priorities. As you read and learn, it’ll become easier to spot important gaps that you can help to fill. Likewise, if you’re a practitioner or a policy-maker, your accumulated daily observations will generate ideas.</p>
<p>But let’s assume that this does not describe you today. So where do YOU start?</p>
<p>Students often come to me with a general awareness about a health challenge, not a specific problem or research idea. “I’m interested in mental health”, they’ll say. For students at this early stage of training, I usually encourage them to adopt someone else’s research problem and jump into an ongoing project to gain experience, rather than develop an independent project.</p>
<p>Aside from soaking in experience, there are also steps you can take to expose yourself to new ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the health and science sections of major news publications and set alerts for topics you find interesting</li>
<li>Look up the national and international professional associations for your research area and subscribe to their mailing lists</li>
<li>Attend research talks in-person or via online webinars hosted by universities, global health research organizations, or professional associations</li>
<li>Follow experts active on social media</li>
<li>Network with local practitioners and policy-makers who have a front row seat to applied challenges and gaps in our knowledge</li>
</ul>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>Not sure what journals to search? Check out Google Scholar’s <a href="http://ghr.link/top"><em>Top Publications</em></a> feature.</p>
</div></div></div>
<p>Above all else, start reading the scientific literature. A useful strategy for finding reading material is to visit the websites of the most popular journals in your discipline and browse recent issues. Once you find a few articles of interest, try the following strategy for expanding your search and identifying gaps in the literature worth studying:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Find the keywords</strong>: An article’s keywords often make great search terms. Look near the abstract.</li>
<li><strong>Read the Introduction</strong>: A good Introduction will frame gaps in our knowledge of a topic, so pull out a highlighter and get to work.</li>
<li><strong>Review the Discussion</strong>: The Discussion section may also hold new leads. Authors typically use the Discussion to link their study results to the existing literature to demonstrate how the results add to what is already known. A good Discussion section will also include limitations of the current study and might offer ideas for future research.</li>
<li><strong>Take note of the cited authors and journals</strong>: The Reference section holds clues to your next great find. Tools like <em>Google Scholar</em> let you search for these references and discover where else these citations appear.</li>

<strong>Start with systematic reviews</strong>
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>A great starting point in the literature is a special type of review called a systematic review. Systematic reviews critically appraise the best available evidence on a topic and synthesize what we know and don’t know. When you start with a systematic review, you let the experts do some of the hard work for you. I’ll teach you about these reviews in a later chapter.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once you start looking, you’ll find research problems everywhere. Your next challenge will be deciding where to direct your attention and energy. I encourage you to favor problems that meet the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Important to you</li>
<li>Contribute to your field</li>
<li>Meaningful to society</li>
<li>Potentially solvable using systematic, public methods (discussed above)</li>
</ol>
<p>First, the quality of your work will be better if you believe you are working on something interesting and important. Research projects in global health can have a long life-cycle with ups and downs. A genuine interest in solving the problem can help you get through the low points.</p>
<p>Second, when selecting a research problem for study, you should seek to understand from the outset how the answers will contribute to your field. Will your study provide an initial answer to a known problem? Clarify an issue marked by contradictory findings? Support an evolving consensus or provide an important counterpoint to a previously held view? Bring attention to an overlooked issue or apply cross-disciplinary learning to help scholars in your field think differently about a problem? Knowing your study’s purpose will help you to frame your contribution.</p>
<p>Not everyone will agree on the the third criterion, importance to society. There are many areas in research, especially in the basic sciences, where you can engage in scientifically important work without knowing if or how that work might benefit society one day. I believe global health is different. There are almost endless applied problems to solve, and you can’t work on all of them. Therefore, in asking to you find problems that are meaningful to society, I’m really suggesting that you be intentional. You’ll make many decisions over your career—decisions about training programs, mentors, grant opportunities, collaborators—and each decision has an opportunity cost. Some research problems won’t be a good use of your time and talent (ask me how I know), and we need both to solve big problems. When deciding to pursue new work, stop and ask yourself, “How are we better off if we solve this problem?”</p>

<p>The decolonizing global health movement encourages us to reflect on who gets to define the research agenda. If you’re drawn to research problems that require fieldwork with a community that is not your own, start by soliciting local perspectives and building a team to conceptualize the problem and design the research.

<section id="describe" class="level3 unnumbered page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="describe">DESCRIBE</h3>
<p>Every study uses an element of description. Let’s say you recruit a sample of 100 people who suffer from the same disorder and conduct a trial to estimate the effect of a new drug on some clinical outcome. When you summarize what you know about these 100 people at the time they were recruited, for instance the average age of the group, you’re describing your sample. Descriptive summaries appear in nearly every research article, usually as ‘Table 1’. But we must distinguish between the use of <em>descriptive statistics</em>—e.g., what is the mean age of these 100 people, the sample—and <em>descriptive research questions</em>.</p>
<p>Description is important in every discipline, but possibly no more so than in epidemiology. Epidemiologists ask descriptive research questions about people, place, and time. Fox and colleagues define <strong>descriptive epidemiology</strong> as follows <span class="citation" data-cites="fox:2022">(<a href="references.html#ref-fox:2022" role="doc-biblioref">Fox et al., 2022</a>)</span>:</p>

<p>Descriptive epidemiology seeks to characterize the distributions of health, disease, and harmful or beneficial exposures in a well-defined population as they exist, including any meaningful differences in distribution, and whether that distribution is changing over time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s break down this definition.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Descriptive epidemiology seeks <strong>to characterize the distributions of health, disease, and harmful or beneficial exposures…</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To “characterize the distribution” of something means to describe how often it occurs. The focus of descriptive studies is frequently a health <em>status</em> (often referred to as an <em>outcome</em>), like cancer, or potential <em>exposures</em>, such as environmental carcinogens. But description extends to knowledge, attitudes, practices—what people know, think, and do. For instance, a study might ask, “What percentage of women of reproductive age in Nepal use a modern method of contraception?”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Descriptive epidemiology seeks to characterize the distributions of health, disease, and harmful or beneficial exposures <strong>in a well-defined population as they exist</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>‘as they exist’ alludes to the notion that if your goal is description, statistical adjustment for confounding might be unnecessary or worse. You likely just want to quantify what you know about a particular group.</p>
</div></div><p>To ask a good descriptive research question, you must be clear about who makes up your group of interest, or your target population. I expand on this idea in a later chapter on sampling, so for now I’ll simply say that your target population is often a specific group, such as women of reproductive age in Nepal. Typically you’ll recruit a sample of individuals from this group and use the data you collect to make an inference from this limited sample to the larger group—your target population.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Descriptive epidemiology seeks to characterize the distributions of health, disease, and harmful or beneficial exposures in a well-defined population as they exist, <strong>including any meaningful differences in distribution, and whether that distribution is changing over time</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>Demography is another field that leans hard into description, often focusing on describing trends in births, deaths, marriage, employment, education, and migration.</p>
</div></div><p>There are often theoretical or programmatic reasons to quantify variation, or differences, in an outcome or exposure across subgroups (people), geographies (place), and time. For instance, you might want to stratify an analysis by ethnicity and race to quantify disparities in outcomes or in access to services. Doing this over time tells you whether conditions are improving, worsening, or staying the same.</p>
<p>Here’s an example to tie it all together. The descriptive research question is, “What percentage of women of reproductive age in Nepal use a modern method of contraception?”</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">

For instance, in 2011 DHS researchers surveyed a random sample of 10,826 households across Nepal and interviewed 12,674 women between the ages of 15 and 49 about their health behaviors and preferences <span class="citation" data-cites="dhsnepal2011">(<a href="references.html#ref-dhsnepal2011" role="doc-biblioref">Ministry of Health and Population et al., 2011</a>)</span>.

Stratified by age, modern method use was twice as common among married women ages 35 to 49 compared to married women ages 15 to 24 (see <a href="#fig-dhsnepal">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.1</span></a>).</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="explain">EXPLAIN</h3>
<p>Description is essential to science and decision-making related to needs and resources. The result from Nepal suggests that more than half of married women of reproductive age were not using a modern method of contraception in 2010. This is a very useful thing to know if you work for the Ministry of Health and are concerned about promoting reproductive health.</p>
<p>But you probably also want to go the next step and ask, “<em>Why</em> is uptake relatively low among younger women?”, and “<em>What happens if</em> we introduce a new policy or program intended to promote contraceptive use?”. Can we explain patterns of modern method use?</p>
<section id="qualitative-inquiry" class="level4 unnumbered page-columns page-full">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="qualitative-inquiry">Qualitative Inquiry</h4>
<p>One way to explore a “why” question is simply to ask people. That’s what Navin Bhatt and colleagues did in Nepal to better understand the reasons for low use of modern methods of contraception among young people <span class="citation" data-cites="bhatt:2021">(<a href="references.html#ref-bhatt:2021" role="doc-biblioref">Bhatt et al., 2021</a>)</span>. The research team organized six group discussions and conducted 25 interviews with a diverse mix of informants from one village, including teachers, youths, health workers, religious leaders, and government officials. One woman explained her non-use this way:</p>

<p>The authors analyzed transcripts with passages like this and reported that young people face numerous barriers to initiating family planning, including a lack of awareness as described by this woman.

<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="causal-inference">Causal Inference</h4>
<p>Another common method for exploring “why” and “what if” questions is explanatory modeling, or the use of statistical models for testing causal explanations <span class="citation" data-cites="shmueli:2010">(<a href="references.html#ref-shmueli:2010" role="doc-biblioref">Shmueli, 2010</a>)</span>. This work also falls under the label of <strong>causal inference</strong>, or what <span class="citation" data-cites="gelman:2020">Gelman et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-gelman:2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> define as follows:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes researchers ask these questions in the context of an experiment that features random assignment to conditions and some active introduction of the treatment, intervention, or exposure. But as Shmueli explains, most often research in the social sciences tests or quantifies associations between variables in non-experimental data.</p>
<p>Let’s consider two examples of the type of causal inference that we’ll examine in later chapters. Both examples come from Nepal and feature the issue of modern method use.</p>
<p>In our first example, <span class="citation" data-cites="wu:2020">Wu et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-wu:2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> looked at the prevalence of modern contraceptive use in a rural municipality in one of Nepal’s poorest districts before and after a pilot program called <em>Nyaya Health Nepal</em> was implemented. In this program, community health workers conducted home visits with pregnant women and new mothers and offered them contraceptive counseling. The authors reported that modern method use increased from 29% pre-intervention to 46% post-intervention (see <a href="#fig-wu2020">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.2</span></a>). But as we’ll discuss, this non-experimental design requires some strong assumptions for attributing the observed change to this program.</p>

In this design, which you’ll meet more formally in a later chapter, the counseling intervention was turned on in six hospitals in a stepwise fashion. The three hospitals randomly assigned to Group 1 received the intervention first in a staggered start. Approximately six months later, the remaining hospitals began offering the counseling intervention, one after the other. <a href="#fig-pradhan2019">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.3</span></a> demonstrates that rates of uptake appeared to jump in each group after the intervention was introduced.

<strong>GLOBAL HEALTH IN PRACTICE: Postpartum family planning</strong>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Research in low-income countries has estimated that nearly all women want to prevent or space their next pregnancy after they have just given birth, but 6 in 10 women do not start a method of family planning after delivering a baby. Precisely when women become fertile after childbirth varies and is influenced by factors like breastfeeding, but in most cases ovulation returns before family planning is started. This puts women at risk of getting pregnant again before they want to. One option is to have an intrauterine device, or IUD, inserted immediately after delivery of the placenta or within the first month postpartum.</p>

Data scientists who might have once worked hard for incremental gains in the quality of Netflix’s movie recommendations are now searching for ways to teach computers to outperform radiologists in detecting pathology.

<p>Returning to the topic of contraception, prediction models might help us to address a key public health challenge: more than 1 in 3 women in low- and middle-income countries stop using contraception within 12 months of starting, putting them at risk for unintended and mistimed pregnancies. What if there was a way to accurately predict who would eventually discontinue and offer them additional support when starting a new method of contraception?</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="rothschild:2020">Rothschild et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-rothschild:2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> took on this question, recruiting a cohort of more than 700 Kenyan women who did not want to get pregnant and following up with them over the course of 24 weeks to see who remained on a method and who stopped. The authors used data from 75% of the women to develop a discontinuation risk score (based on things like method choice, education, marital status) and reserved the remaining 25% to validate their new tool. The authors found that discontinuation was almost 2-6 times higher among women labeled as high risk vs low risk, but the positive predictive value of the score was only 31%. This means that most women labeled by the tool as “high risk” did not actually discontinue. In practice, mislabeling women as high risk for discontinuation would be unlikely to cause harm, but it could direct scarce resources to people who don’t need additional support.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"></div><p><strong>Feasible</strong>: Some research questions will take a long time to answer, cost too much, require too many participants, demand skills or equipment that you do not have, or will be too complex to implement. A good research question is not just answerable, it’s feasible for YOU to answer it with the resources currently at your disposal.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting</strong>: Research requires funding and effort. If you don’t ask a sufficiently interesting question, you won’t get funding. If you manage to get funding but lose interest in the question, you might not finish the work. Unlike some other domains, global health research tends to have long timelines, and it’s important to work on things you’ll find interesting over the long term.</p>
<p><strong>Novel</strong>: Replication is an important part of science, but the majority of global health funding goes to research that asks new and interesting questions. Therefore, you should prioritize answering questions that fill a gap in our knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical</strong>: Google’s motto used to be, “don’t be evil”. This is a minimum bar for research with human subjects. You have a responsibility to ensure that the questions you ask and the methods you employ in search of answers shield participants from harm.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant</strong>: In addition to being interesting, a research question should also be relevant to science and society. The answer should move your field forward in some way. Making this determination requires a thorough review of the literature and conversations with senior colleagues.</p>

<p>Let’s use PICO to develop a research question about the efficacy of mosquito bed nets in preventing malaria. The <strong>problem</strong> is malaria infections. The <strong>population</strong> is children under 5 years of age. Because intervention studies tend to be smaller in reach than nationally representative surveys, we might add “living around the Lake Victoria basin in Kenya”. The <strong>intervention</strong> is the application of an insecticide-treated net. The comparison group might be children living in families who are provided an untreated bed net.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> One <strong>outcome</strong> measure could be the rate of parasitaemia after the intervention.</p>
<p>We combine all of these elements into a single research question:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Among children under 5 years of age living around the Lake Victoria basin in Kenya, are insecticide-treated mosquito nets more effective than untreated nets at preventing parasitaemia?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine that we wanted to study the uptake or use of bed nets. We could ask a descriptive research question like, “How many children sleep under bed nets?” It’s a good start, but this question is too general. Children of what age? Living where? We also need to define what we mean by sleeping under a bed net. In this line of research, it is common to ask about the previous night, as in the night before the survey.</p>
<p>A better way to phrase the question is, “What percentage of children under 5 years of age in Kenya slept under an insecticide treated net the previous night?” An example of an explanatory research question on the same topic is, “What are the correlates of insecticide treated net use among families with children under 5 years of age in Kenya?”</p>
